## 🔧 Key Steps Performed

1. 🧹 Loaded preprocessed dataset (`cleaned_churn_data.csv`)  
2. 🎯 Separated features (`X`) and target (`y`)  
3. 🔀 Split dataset into training and testing sets  
4. ⚙️ Trained a Logistic Regression model on customer data  
5. 📈 Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and classification report  
6. 🧊 Visualized results using a confusion matrix heatmap  
7. 💡 Included churn probability predictions (optional)

## 📈 Final Output

- ✅ Functional churn prediction model  
- ✅ Evaluation metrics that reflect model performance  
- ✅ Ready for deployment or integration into dashboards  
- ✅ Built in Colab with all explanations and outputs visualized
